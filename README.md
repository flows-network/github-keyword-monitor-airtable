[Deploy this function on flows.network](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/github-keyword-monitor-airtable), and you can save the GitHub issues that mention a keyword set by you to an Airtable table. For example, if you set the keyword as WasmEdge, any GitHub issues include WasmEdge will be saved to the Airtable table.

## How it works

This function is triggered by time. At the specified time, the bot searches for all GitHub issues from the past 24 hours, filters them based on your chosen keyword and saves the results into an Airtable table.

## Deploy your own code review bot in 3 simple steps

1. Create a bot from a template
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Configure the bot to review PRs on a specified GitHub repo

### 0 Prerequisites

You need to sign into [flows.network](https://flows.network/) from your GitHub account. It is free.

[A pre-built Airtable table](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invN9XkuZjUpVoKZ8&inviteToken=a9c5477d82e73c73b0e5228cdb4083434be061d115e7e88b89ee9df1b3ff4d8b&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts) to save the results.

### 1 Create a bot from a template

[**Just click here**](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/github-keyword-monitor-airtable)

<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/flows-network/github-keyword-monitor-airtable/assets/45785633/d5f06598-13fb-4692-b7fa-3712d7ac181e">


Review the `keyword` variable. Type any topic that you're interested in. Only support one word here.

Click on the **Create and Build** button.

### 2 Configure the flow to access airtable

You will now set up Airtable integration.

Here are three parameters you need to type. Click [How to connect Airtable](https://flows.network/blog/airtable) for more information.

* airtable_table_name: the name of the table you want to add data, which you can find on Airtable.
* airtable_base_id: the base id to which the table you wish to add or retrieve data belongs, which you can find on Airtable.
* airtable_token_name: the name of the Airtable API token, which is defined by you

Then, click on the **Connect** or **+ Add new authentication** button, enter your key, and give it a name.

Close the tab and go back to the flow.network page once you are done. Click on **Deploy**.

### Wait for the magic!

This is it! You are now on the flow details page waiting for the flow function to build. As soon as the flow's status became `running`, the flow is ready to monitor all the GitHub issues!
